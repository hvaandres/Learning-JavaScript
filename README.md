# Learning-JavaScript
This is a basic guide to learn JavaScript

I would like like to teach you all the knowledge that I learned in my coding journey. In this way, you will be able to see my examples and some examples that I found on the web. In other words, you will have this open library to share your knowledge with others.


# Education should be free
This Github account is to help others to learn how to start to code!
