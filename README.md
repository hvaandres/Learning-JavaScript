# Learning-JavaScript
This is a basic guide to learn JavaScript

I would like like to teach you all the knowledge that I learned in my coding journey. In this way, you will be able to see my examples and some examples that I found on the web. In other words, you will have this open library to share your knowledge with me and others. The idea of this is to start helping others for free and if you have more questions or concerns let me know and I would be more than happy to help you.
